# XO Game

## Overview

The XO game, also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a classic two-player game where players alternate marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with either "X" or "O." The goal is to be the first player to place three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The game is easy to play, fun, and suitable for all ages.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Players alternate between placing "X" and "O".
- **3x3 Grid**: The game board consists of 9 spaces arranged in a 3x3 grid.
- **Win Conditions**: The first player to line up three marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- **Draw Detection**: The game can also detect when there are no moves left, resulting in a draw.
- **Clear board option**: Option to restart the game after completion.

## How to Play

1. **Player 1** uses "X" and **Player 2** uses "O".
2. Players take turns to mark an empty space on the grid.
3. The objective is to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
4. If all 9 spaces are filled without either player winning, the game is a draw.
5. To restart the game after completion, simply reset the board.

## Game Rules

- Players can only place their mark on an empty space.
- The game alternates between players after each move.
- The first player to place three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
- If the grid is full and no one has won, the game results in a draw.
